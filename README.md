## Project Overview
In an era where traffic congestion and safety are paramount, our project aims to enhance road traffic management through advanced image recognition technology. We developed a real-time traffic situation classification system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in conjunction with OpenCV and Python.

## Key Features
- **Traffic Classification:** The system categorizes traffic conditions into three distinct classes: **'No Traffic,' 'Medium Traffic,' and 'Heavy Traffic.'**
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Operates in real time using a simple webcam setup.
- **High Accuracy:** Trained with over 3,000 labeled images to achieve robust classification performance.

## Technical Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.6
- **Libraries:**
  - **Keras:** 2.3.1
  - **OpenCV:** Latest version
  - **TensorFlow:** 2.0.0
  - **Scikit-Learn:** 0.22.1
  - **Other Libraries:** pickle, imutils, pathlib, PySimpleGUI

## Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset comprising over 3,000 images across three classes of traffic conditions.

## Objectives
1. **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring:** Utilize a webcam to monitor and classify traffic conditions instantaneously.
2. **High Accuracy Classification:** Implement CNNs to generalize and classify traffic scenarios effectively.
3. **User-Friendly Interface:** Create a simple GUI for easy interaction and visualization of traffic conditions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the capabilities of machine learning in traffic management and paves the way for future enhancements in smart city infrastructure. By providing a reliable method for traffic classification, we aim to contribute to more efficient urban mobility solutions.
