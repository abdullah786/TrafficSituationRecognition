# Road Traffic Recognition Using Convolution Neural Networks CNN | OPENCV Python 

Name : Syed Muhammad Abdullah Ahsan and Moin Abbas Qureshi

Train and classify Traffic situations using Convolutional neural networks This will be done using 
 OPENCV in real time using a simple webcam.CNNs have been gaining popularity in the past couple of years due to their ability to generalize and classify the data with high accuracies.
  In this project we trained traffic situations with over 3000 images of 3 different classes ['No Traffic', 'Medium Traffic', 'Heavy Traffic'] with the help of tensorflow and keras .
